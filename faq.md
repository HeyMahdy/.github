# FAQ Regarding UIU-DH

> Do we need to use our university Emails to sign up for the Discord Account?

_"No, like messenger Discord is also a personal messaging and social media platform. The only time you'll require a Uni Email is to verify that you are a student of UIU and the Email Belongs to you"_

> Can we use discord outside of UIU DH Activity?

_" Of course Infact discord is a great platform to use as a communication platform with your gaming buddies (if you have any that is :3)"_

> Is My Uni Email going to be safe?

_"Now the only use of the E-Mail will be for the Automatic Verification and only Super Admins will have access to that incase they reach out to you with more learning experience"_

One of my friends sent me a link and is asking me to relog back into discord should I do it?

" Now this is a long topic diving deep into the Cyber Security space too but the short answer is if you don't trust the link or is doubtful don't give your account access to shady links"

Memes?

"UIU DH Discord will be used asa professional space as we will have our Alumni , Instructor's and Faculty in it too so try and use some Engineering Braincells and you should be fine"

Can we keep using messenger?

" Well, You can but from here on out project proposals meetings , contributions and such there off will only be accepted through either E-Mail or Discord so you can keep using Messenger just you'll be missing out as Discord and Email will be our first priority for Community Outreach and Communication"

I'm still confused as to what are the benefits of being a Member of UIU DH or Contributions to someone else's project

" Members will receive some professional showcase able roles and since it's free you don't have to worry about paying a fee of such to keep you're membership"
